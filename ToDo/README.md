1. Build Pinteret-like Website quickly

   1.1 Implement Image Carousel 
   
   1.2 Implement FlipBook

2. Try to implement Image Analyzers with Various Proposals

   2.1 Clustering, Deep Learning, LDA, Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization, etc
       
   ```2.1.1``` [Deep Ranking](https://github.com/Chasego/Sharedream/blob/master/res/img_similarity/deep_ranking.pdf)
   
   ```2.1.2``` (Rather than ___Image Similarity___) the ultimate objective is ___Style Similarity___. [One paper] (https://github.com/Chasego/kovipo/blob/master/res/img_style/1508.06576v1.pdf) can be the main reference. _Style_ is an abstract concept. However, since this paper shows the image generation from one image based on another image with the _Style_ we want. It shows some clubes that _Style_ can be defined, described and measured to some extent. 

   2.2 Implement different methods with Customer Feedback Buttons

3. A server which can handle peak throughput 

4. Evaluatation System and Data Collector

5. Integrate DeepDream

6. Deploy on AWS

7. Utilize EMR

8. Data Visualization / Resume Visualization

9. Directions

   9.1 Resume Visualization
   
   9.2 More Efficient Communication (turn words into imgs, relationship is important)
