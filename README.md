__Kovipo__ (mixed name from {Greek : κοινό όνειρο , English : shared dream , Chinese : 共同的梦想})

It's a practise to combine my knowledge on _Django, Tornado, MongoDB, Spark, Recommendation System, Deep Learning_.

+ What I'm trying to do is to build a search enginer & recommendation system mainly based on the shared images themselves.

+ It will be very similar to Pinterest. However, it will be much more fun than Pinterest because it's trying to ___Understand Images from Scratch___. To analyze two people's preference over images only based on the images they share is pretty interesting and amazing. So I call this project as __Kovipo__ because I believe the preferences over images is just like images in high-dimensions.

+ It will be a lot of fun!
